# Electric-Formula-Student-Simulation


# Overviw
Overview
This project analyzes vehicle speed and battery status (temperature, state of charge, voltage, and current) based on throttle and braking angles input over time. The primary script and associated Simulink model are provided for this analysis.

# Repository Contents
1 setup.m: Initialization script for setting up the necessary parameters and loading required data.
2 FS.slx: Simulink model file to run the main simulation.
 simulink_cache.xml: Simulink cache files.
3 fastest-lapBraking.mat, fastest-lapBraking2.mat, fastest-lapBraking3.mat, fastest-lapBraking4.mat: Data files for braking angles.
4 fastest-lapThrottel.mat, fastest-lapThrottel2.mat, fastest-lapThrottel3.mat, fastest-lapThrottel4.mat: Data files for throttle angles.
5 BatterySpcifications.mat: Contains battery specifications used in the setup script.
6 charging.mat: Additional data file for charging parameters.
